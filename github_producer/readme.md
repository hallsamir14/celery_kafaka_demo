2. As a user, I want to subscribe to a specific GitHub repository by providing the repository URL. üìù
3. As a user, I want the system to automatically import the repository data and commit history when I subscribe to a repository. ‚¨áÔ∏è
4. As a user, I want the system to receive real-time updates whenever new commits are pushed to a subscribed repository. üîÑ
5. As a user, I want the system to publish the repository data and commit information to Kafka topics for further processing and analysis. üì§
6. As a user, I want the system to handle authentication and authorization securely using JWT tokens. üîí
7. As a user, I want the system to provide error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data processing. ‚ôªÔ∏è
8. As a user, I want the system to be scalable and able to handle a large number of subscribed repositories and high commit activity. üìà

- `/github/subscribe`: Endpoint for subscribing to a GitHub repository.

#### Kafka Topics: üì¢
- `github_commits`: Topic for publishing commit data.
- `github_repositories`: Topic for publishing repository data.

#### Security: üõ°Ô∏è
- JWT authentication is used to secure the API endpoints.
- Access tokens are stored securely in Redis.
- HTTPS can be enabled for secure communication.

#### Error Handling and Retry: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Exception handlers are implemented to handle and log errors.
- Retry mechanism is applied to critical operations like data import and Kafka message production.

#### Caching: üíæ
- Redis is used as a caching mechanism to store access tokens for efficient retrieval.

#### Logging: üìã
- Structured logging is implemented using the `logging` module and a JSON configuration file.
- Log messages are generated for important events and errors.

### Installation and Setup: üöÄ

#### Environment Variables:
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: GitHub OAuth Client ID for authentication.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth Client Secret for authentication.
- `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Comma-separated list of Kafka bootstrap servers.
- `REDIS_HOST`: Redis host for caching and storing access tokens.
- `REDIS_PORT`: Redis port for caching and storing access tokens.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT authentication.

#### Docker Compose Setup:
To run the entire system using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/github-monitoring-system.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd github-monitoring-system`
4. Set the required environment variables (mentioned above) in a `.env` file.
5. Run `docker-compose up` to start all the services (web application, Kafka, Redis, etc.).

#### Kafka Explanation: üêò
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-volume and high-velocity data streams, making it an ideal choice for processing and analyzing data from multiple sources in real-time.

In this system, Kafka is used as a messaging system to publish repository data and commit information. The Kafka producer component publishes the data to Kafka topics, which can then be consumed by downstream applications or data processing components. This decoupling of the producer and consumer allows for better scalability, reliability, and fault-tolerance.

Using Kafka also enables real-time processing and analysis of the data, as the data is immediately available for consumption as soon as it is published to the topics. This is particularly useful for applications that require real-time monitoring and alerting based on repository activity or commit patterns.

#### Microservices Architecture: üè¢
The GitHub Repository Monitoring and Analysis System follows a microservices architecture, which is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

In this system, the main components are:

1. **Web Application**: Handles user authentication, GitHub OAuth integration, and repository subscription management.
2. **Kafka Producer**: Publishes repository data and commit information to Kafka topics.
3. **Data Processing**: Consumes data from Kafka topics and performs further analysis and storage.

By following a microservices architecture, the system benefits from improved scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation. Each component can be scaled independently based on demand, and updates or changes to one component do not affect the others, as long as the communication contracts (e.g., Kafka topics) are maintained.

Additionally, the microservices architecture allows for easier integration with other systems or services, as each component exposes well-defined interfaces (e.g., API endpoints, Kafka topics) for communication.

### General Overview: üìö

The GitHub Repository Monitoring and Analysis System is a powerful tool designed to help users monitor and analyze GitHub repositories in real-time. By integrating with the GitHub API, the system allows users to link their GitHub accounts and subscribe to specific repositories they want to monitor.

When a user subscribes to a repository, the system automatically imports the repository data, including the repository details and the entire commit history. It leverages pagination to retrieve commits in batches, ensuring efficient handling of large repositories.

The system also sets up webhooks for subscribed repositories, enabling real-time monitoring of new commits. Whenever a new commit is pushed to a subscribed repository, the system receives the webhook event, processes the commit data, and publishes it to a Kafka topic for further analysis.

To ensure data integrity and reliability, the system incorporates error handling and retry mechanisms. Critical operations, such as importing repository data and producing messages to Kafka, are wrapped with retry functionality to handle transient failures and ensure successful processing.

The system prioritizes security by implementing JWT authentication for API endpoints. User access tokens are securely stored in Redis, providing efficient retrieval and management of authentication credentials.

Structured logging is employed throughout the system to capture important events, errors, and debugging information. The logging configuration is defined in a JSON file, allowing for flexible and centralized management of logging behavior.

The GitHub Repository Monitoring and Analysis System serves as a foundation for further data processing and analysis. By publishing repository and commit data to Kafka topics, the system enables downstream applications to consume and analyze the data in real-time. This opens up possibilities for various use cases, such as generating insights, detecting anomalies, or triggering automated actions based on repository activity.

With its scalable architecture, robust error handling, and real-time monitoring capabilities, the GitHub Repository Monitoring and Analysis System empowers users to gain valuable insights from their GitHub repositories and make data-driven decisions based on commit activity and repository metrics. üöÄ
